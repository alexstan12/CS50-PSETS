The final project for CS50 - a simple web app that lets the user create his own route with more than 25 waypoints,
which is the limit set on Google Maps.
You can add locations for your route by entering them in a search box,
or simply click the map to set a waypoint.
Routes data is safe when leaving the page, all important information is stored in a localStorage via JS.
The app was made possible mainly with JS and GoogleMaps API for route rendering and data manipulation,
HTML/CSS and Python with Flask for the web-server.
